# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Focus Journey is a focus timer app where each session reveals a piece of a procedurally-generated story told through illustrated isometric 3D scenes. Users set daily focus goals, complete timed sessions, and watch puzzle pieces fade away to reveal scenes with narrative text generated by Claude API.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite
- **3D Rendering:** React Three Fiber (R3F) + Drei
- **State:** Zustand (with localStorage persistence planned)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (configured via @tailwindcss/vite plugin)
- **Story Generation:** Anthropic Claude API via Vercel serverless proxy
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Architecture

### Screen Flow
`Welcome → SessionSetup → Focus (with timer + 3D scene) → Summary`

The app uses a single Zustand store (`src/stores/focusStore.js`) that manages:
- Current screen routing via `currentScreen` state
- Session configuration (duration, theme, goal)
- Timer state (remaining, total, isRunning, isPaused)
- Scene state (sprites revealed)
- Story fragments from LLM

### Key Patterns

**Screen Routing:** No router library. `App.jsx` conditionally renders screens based on `currentScreen` from the store.

**Timer Logic:** Timer stores start time and calculates elapsed on each tick. This allows the timer to work correctly when the tab is backgrounded—on return, it recalculates from the stored start time.

**3D Scene:** `SceneCanvas` wraps R3F Canvas. Uses OrbitControls (restricted) with an isometric-style camera. Sprites use Billboard components for 2D-on-3D effect.

### Serverless API

`api/generate-story.js` proxies requests to Claude API to keep the API key server-side. Expects POST with `{ prompt, theme, previousFragments }`.

## Custom Theme Colors

Defined in `src/index.css` using Tailwind v4's `@theme` directive:
- `forest-*` (greens: 500-900)
- `teal-*` (400-600)
- `amber-*` (400-500)
- `stone-*` (50-900)

Use as `bg-forest-800`, `text-teal-500`, etc.
